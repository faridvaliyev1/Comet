1. We always start partitioning phase by looking for the clusters of highest supports
2. In clustering we look for the longest cluster first then support threshold 
3. Create interface from ST 
4. experiment on real dataset even if small, becuase you gonna try cleaning the predicates to be column names 
5. Try to think of a way of labelling the ouptput tables, as starting point you can start from the emergent schema paper.
